# Question

Consider this `InstagramContextProvider` component below.

**Question:** When using the "Global Context Provider" pattern, what will the `children` be? In other words, what component will this `InstagramContextProvider` be wrapped around?

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import InstagramContext from './InstagramContext';

const InstagramContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
	const [totalLikes, setTotalLikes] = useState(0);
	const incrementTotalLikes = () => setTotalLikes(totalLikes + 1);

	const contextValues = { totalLikes, incrementTotalLikes };

	return (
		<InstagramContext.Provider value={contextValues}>
			{children}
		</InstagramContext.Provider>
	);
};

export default InstagramContextProvider;
```

# Answer

In the InstagramContextProvider component, children are the components that are wrapped inside it. Those 'children' will have access to the context values provided by the provider.

To share data or values across multiple components in React, we can use useContext. To make these values accessible throughout the entire application, we can wrap our App component (which usually contains all other components) with a Provider.

When we wrap the App component with a Provider, it makes the context's values available to all components within the Appâ€”effectively making the data "global" across the application. This allows any component, no matter how deeply nested, to access the values provided by the context without having to pass props manually through each component layer.

So, by wrapping the App in a Provider, you allow the context to be accessible globally across your front-end.
