# Question

Consider this `InstagramContextProvider` component below.

**Question:** When using the "Global Context Provider" pattern, what will the `children` be? In other words, what component will this `InstagramContextProvider` be wrapped around?

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import InstagramContext from './InstagramContext';

const InstagramContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
	const [totalLikes, setTotalLikes] = useState(0);
	const incrementTotalLikes = () => setTotalLikes(totalLikes + 1);

	const contextValues = { totalLikes, incrementTotalLikes };

	return (
		<InstagramContext.Provider value={contextValues}>
			{children}
		</InstagramContext.Provider>
	);
};

export default InstagramContextProvider;
```

# Answer

In the InstagramContextProvider component, children are the components that are wrapped inside it. Those 'children' will have access to the context values provided by the provider.

To make values/data that were passed into useContext, we can make it global by wrapping it around a component that holds "everything" which is our app!
When the provider is wrapped around the app. Since the app usually holds other components or I guess essentially our "entire" frontEnd is contained within the "app" component. By Wrapping the app we enable context to be global.

While that is correct! If we're aiming to make the context global, the InstagramContextProvider should be wrapped around the <App /> component. This ensures that all components within the app can access the contextValues, not just the descendants of a specific component.
